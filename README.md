Welcome to the Trendy Toys project! This repository contains the code for a startup specializing in the sale of games, toys, and gaming equipment (Xbox, PlayStation, Baby-Foot, etc.). Our goal is to develop a website that highlights our products and attracts more customers.

## Project Overview

During this project, we will:
- Develop the website using JavaScript.
- Employ functional programming paradigms to enhance code readability and maintainability.
- Utilize React JS for building UI pages and components.
- Implement asynchronous code using generators with async/await.
- Follow the SAGE(S) driven design principles to ensure the site is Semantic, Accessible, Green, Easy, and Secure.
